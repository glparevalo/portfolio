    "process": "In this project, I built an end-to-end data pipeline using the Medallion (Bronze-Silver-Gold) architecture to transform raw LAPD crime data into actionable insights via Power BI dashboards. After initializing the environment with SQL Server, I ingested raw CSV data into the Bronze layer for traceability. In the Silver layer, I cleaned and standardized the data using SQL, then normalized it into a Snowflake schema to improve data integrity and reduce redundancy. At the Gold layer, I denormalized the data into a Star schema optimized for analytics and built semantic Gold Views. These views powered a fully interactive Power BI dashboard featuring crime heatmaps, yearly trend analysis, and victim demographic insights. The structured approach ensured scalable data processing, robust modeling, and user-friendly visual reporting.",
